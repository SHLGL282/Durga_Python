     name='sahil'
     salary=20000
     friend='mohit'
     print("Hello {}, your salary is {} and your friend {} came to meet you. ".format(name,salary,friend))
     print("Hello {0}, your salary is {1} and your friend {2} came to meet you. ".format(name,salary,friend))
     print("Hello {n}, your salary is {s} and your friend {f} came to meet you. ".format(n=name,s=salary,f=friend))

     Formatted string:
     %i --> Signed decimal value
     %d --> Signed decimal value
     %f --> for float
     %s --> for string and other objects like list, tuple, etc..

     Ex :
     print("hello %s, your salary is %d and your friend %s came to meet you." %(name, salary, friend))

     a=17.78967 #print only 2 values after decimal
     print("value of a is %.2f" %a)
          Result >>>  value of a is 17.79
